              "  b\"good films are hard to find these days . \\ngreat films are beyond rare . \\nproof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . \\na taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . \\nconsider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . \\ni haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway . \\nbut enough with the gossip , let's get to the review . \\nthe film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . \\nupon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . \\nthe only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . \\nwith no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . \\nbut when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . \\nthe film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . \\nthe script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne . \\nthe biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . \\ndug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor . \\nryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . \\nthe most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . \\nthe bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters . \\nthe scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . \\ndirector taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . \\nproof of life is a thinking man's action movie . \\nit is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night . \\n\"],\n",

) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . \\nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . \\nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . \\nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . \\napollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . \\njim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . \\nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . \\nif they ever reach it . \\ned harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . \\naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . \\nalso , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . \\nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . \\nwatch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . \\na bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . \\nthose who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . \\nthis is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . \\nyou should enjoy it . \\n\",\n          \"_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . \\nmitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . \\nbut as the trailer goes , \\\" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . \\\" \\nso he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . \\nthis should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . \\nin fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam's father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . \\nso for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a \\nheart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . \\nnot that there isn't a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . \\nthere are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam's impotent father's ongoing lust for them . \\nand for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america's_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . \\nbut the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? \\nthe answer is a resounding no . \\nit's not that macdonald isn't a funny guy . \\nhe was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn't hurt that he's a natural , likable screen presence . \\nhe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don't work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . \\nstill , macdonald's few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . \\nthe late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . \\nsaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . \\nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . \\ncome to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . \\n\",\n          \"while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . \\nwords \\\" croatia \\\" and \\\" croatians \\\" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \\nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \\nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \\nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \\nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \\nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \\nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \\nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \\nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba . \\nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \\nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \\nit shouldn't surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \\nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman's the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \\nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \\nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \\nthe movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \\nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \\nhis performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking , yet adequate . \\nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the \\\" normal \\\" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \\nalthough the movie doesn't lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken's , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \\nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon's reluctant colleague . \\nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \\nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \\nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \\nirvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \\nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \\nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \\nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't help . \\nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . \\n\"\n        ],\n

) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . \\nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . \\nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . \\nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . \\napollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . \\njim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . \\nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . \\nif they ever reach it . \\ned harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . \\naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . \\nalso , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . \\nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . \\nwatch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . \\na bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . \\nthose who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . \\nthis is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . \\nyou should enjoy it . \\n\",\n          \"_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . \\nmitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . \\nbut as the trailer goes , \\\" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . \\\" \\nso he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . \\nthis should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . \\nin fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam's father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . \\nso for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a \\nheart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . \\nnot that there isn't a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . \\nthere are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam's impotent father's ongoing lust for them . \\nand for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america's_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . \\nbut the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? \\nthe answer is a resounding no . \\nit's not that macdonald isn't a funny guy . \\nhe was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn't hurt that he's a natural , likable screen presence . \\nhe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don't work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . \\nstill , macdonald's few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . \\nthe late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . \\nsaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . \\nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . \\ncome to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . \\n\",\n          \"while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . \\nwords \\\" croatia \\\" and \\\" croatians \\\" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \\nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \\nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \\nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \\nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \\nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \\nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \\nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \\nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba . \\nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \\nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \\nit shouldn't surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \\nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman's the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \\nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \\nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \\nthe movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \\nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \\nhis performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking , yet adequate . \\nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the \\\" normal \\\" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \\nalthough the movie doesn't lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken's , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \\nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon's reluctant colleague . \\nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \\nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \\nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \\nirvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \\nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \\nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \\nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't help . \\nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . \\n\"\n        ],\n
