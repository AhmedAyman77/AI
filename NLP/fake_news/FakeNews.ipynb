The timing of Cohen\\u2019s testimony was first reported by NBC. Cohen confirmed that he would testify to the committee on Tuesday and said he did not know whether it would be in a closed session or public. Aides to the committee\\u2019s leaders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen said previously he had received a subpoena from at least one of the congressional committees investigating what U.S. intelligence has determined were Russia\\u2019s efforts to influence the election on Trump\\u2019s behalf, and whether Trump associates colluded with Russia. Russia denies such activity. The White House denies any collusion, but concerns about the issue and Trump\\u2019s ties to Russia have shadowed the first months of the Republican\\u2019s presidency. Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump, would be one of a series of close associates of the president to testify in Congress. Members of both the Senate and House of Representatives committees conducting investigations have said they expect to call more. Trump\\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month. \",\n          \"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s main opposition leader said on Monday President Robert Mugabe s refusal to resign had dampened people s spirits and called for an inclusive political process in the aftermath of a military intervention last week.

It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  Beasley told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley was frustrated that his complaints to management never got addressed, so he sued.  It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  he told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley explained to CBS that he became homeless after he lost his job, so the hefty settlement becomes a huge victory for the grandfather from Compton.His lawyer Scott Cummings hopes that this win sends a message to other businesses out there.  Racism, racial harassment can occur really anywhere even in a black-owned business,  he asserted. Beasley added,  You can t treat people like that and get away with it constantly.

NEW Wikileaks Email: Confidential Auditor\\u2019s Report States Clinton Foundation Is Engaging In ILLEGAL ConductThe report exposed in an email shared by Wikileaks shows the results of a review that was completed in 2011, by Jennifer Reynoso, a New York lawyer. The report states that the Clinton Foundation  is missing several policies/procedures that are required by law (e.g.,record retention policy). The report goes on to give the following recommendation:In addition to pointing out that employees of the Clinton Foundation are underpaid as compared to comparable  positions in other companies, the email also states that the overall morale of the company is low and the staff would like to see more structure.  STAFF MORALE IS LOW AND STAFF IS HUNGRY FOR MORE STRUCTUREIronically, the staff complained about a policy not being made available for an employee to  blow the whistle  on potential wrongdoings within the  non-profit. Given Bill Clinton s history as a sexual predator and his role in the Clinton Foundation, it shouldn t come as a surprise that there isn t a strong  Sexual Harassment  policy in place.\",\n          \" Here Are Just A Few Things America Could Afford If The Wealthy Actually PAID Their Fair ShareIt isn t much of a secret these days that rich people do not pay their fair share of taxes. I m not even talking about the small business owner who loves to complain about having a higher tax bill than some. I mean the offensively wealthy. Multi-millionaires and billionaires that draw a salary they don t need just so they can have a larger pile of money to sit on top of while throwing a middle finger at the middle class.Did you ever wonder,  What could we do in this country if everyone actually paid their fair share of taxes on a progressive scale? The short answer is, we d have about $124 billion extra per year for the government to use.Thanks to a leak of the Panama Papers, which detail just how much money is being hidden by corporations, the wealthy and even world leaders, we can now start to answer that question. Here are a few examples of what we could do with the money:1: Help to reduce the deficitRepublicans always say the federal deficit is the great evil of our time. It prevents everything from your business succeeding to sunny days from happening. $124 billion dollars a year would be able to negate nearly one quarter of the federal deficit. Republicans are strangely silent on this obvious remedy.2: Help to protect the elderlyThanks to Republican shenanigans, Social Security has some budget problems. Currently, it s experiencing a shortfall of about $182 billion because people like Ronald Reagan couldn t keep their hands out of the Social Security lockbox. Rather than consigning our seniors to complete and total poverty for generations to come, $124 billion extra a year could help resolve the Social Security problem until another method can be used to patch the rest and protect 80-year-olds from having to work full-time jobs.3: Fund universal preschoolUniversal pre-k would cost about $90 billion a year. We would actually have money left over from this one. The Economic Policy Institute has already put forth a plan to establish preschool and childcare for parents of infants and toddlers up to 4 years old for just 10 percent of their income. The government would pick up the rest of the tab. The plan would end up paying for itself in the long-term because younger children educated earlier in life will earn more and avoid the need for social welfare programs and have fewer run-ins with our drastically expensive criminal justice system.4: Pay the full salaries of all of our troopsThe Pentagon s personnel costs in 2014 totaled $116 billion dollars. Here we are again with some absolutely huge and important thing being paid for with money to spare, yet Republicans are silent. Strangely enough, even the troops don t motivate them on this one. Republicans LOVE our troops. Right? Sadly no, they don t. They only love having flag draped coffins for photo ops.5: Make sure nobody in America goes hungryAt its recent peak, food stamps cost $80 billion dollars in 2013. It has since lowered as the economy has steadily improved and people have gotten off the program at a modest pace. However, instead of screaming  cut! cut! cut!  as Republicans are inclined to do, we could fully pay for it and have a little over $40 billion a year left to do other things with.Here is a chart showing the costs of a few things, and where the extra money falls in comparison. It s so embarrassing. We could do two of the cheapest ones at the same time and still have a little money left over. But, Republicans are bound and determined to make sure America can t have nice things.Featured image via Flickr\",\n          \"How Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal ElectionsHow Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal Elections\\nAmericans are being told by \\u201cexperts\\u201d (read \\u201cHillary supporters\\u201d) that election fraud in the US is rare. They are also being misinformed that voting fraud would be detected. The fact of the matter is, as has now been proven, that no vast conspiracy is required.

NEW Wikileaks Email: Confidential Auditor\\u2019s Report States Clinton Foundation Is Engaging In ILLEGAL ConductThe report exposed in an email shared by Wikileaks shows the results of a review that was completed in 2011, by Jennifer Reynoso, a New York lawyer. The report states that the Clinton Foundation  is missing several policies/procedures that are required by law (e.g.,record retention policy). The report goes on to give the following recommendation:In addition to pointing out that employees of the Clinton Foundation are underpaid as compared to comparable  positions in other companies, the email also states that the overall morale of the company is low and the staff would like to see more structure.  STAFF MORALE IS LOW AND STAFF IS HUNGRY FOR MORE STRUCTUREIronically, the staff complained about a policy not being made available for an employee to  blow the whistle  on potential wrongdoings within the  non-profit. Given Bill Clinton s history as a sexual predator and his role in the Clinton Foundation, it shouldn t come as a surprise that there isn t a strong  Sexual Harassment  policy in place.\",\n          \" Here Are Just A Few Things America Could Afford If The Wealthy Actually PAID Their Fair ShareIt isn t much of a secret these days that rich people do not pay their fair share of taxes. I m not even talking about the small business owner who loves to complain about having a higher tax bill than some. I mean the offensively wealthy. Multi-millionaires and billionaires that draw a salary they don t need just so they can have a larger pile of money to sit on top of while throwing a middle finger at the middle class.Did you ever wonder,  What could we do in this country if everyone actually paid their fair share of taxes on a progressive scale? The short answer is, we d have about $124 billion extra per year for the government to use.Thanks to a leak of the Panama Papers, which detail just how much money is being hidden by corporations, the wealthy and even world leaders, we can now start to answer that question. Here are a few examples of what we could do with the money:1: Help to reduce the deficitRepublicans always say the federal deficit is the great evil of our time. It prevents everything from your business succeeding to sunny days from happening. $124 billion dollars a year would be able to negate nearly one quarter of the federal deficit. Republicans are strangely silent on this obvious remedy.2: Help to protect the elderlyThanks to Republican shenanigans, Social Security has some budget problems. Currently, it s experiencing a shortfall of about $182 billion because people like Ronald Reagan couldn t keep their hands out of the Social Security lockbox. Rather than consigning our seniors to complete and total poverty for generations to come, $124 billion extra a year could help resolve the Social Security problem until another method can be used to patch the rest and protect 80-year-olds from having to work full-time jobs.3: Fund universal preschoolUniversal pre-k would cost about $90 billion a year. We would actually have money left over from this one. The Economic Policy Institute has already put forth a plan to establish preschool and childcare for parents of infants and toddlers up to 4 years old for just 10 percent of their income. The government would pick up the rest of the tab. The plan would end up paying for itself in the long-term because younger children educated earlier in life will earn more and avoid the need for social welfare programs and have fewer run-ins with our drastically expensive criminal justice system.4: Pay the full salaries of all of our troopsThe Pentagon s personnel costs in 2014 totaled $116 billion dollars. Here we are again with some absolutely huge and important thing being paid for with money to spare, yet Republicans are silent. Strangely enough, even the troops don t motivate them on this one. Republicans LOVE our troops. Right? Sadly no, they don t. They only love having flag draped coffins for photo ops.5: Make sure nobody in America goes hungryAt its recent peak, food stamps cost $80 billion dollars in 2013. It has since lowered as the economy has steadily improved and people have gotten off the program at a modest pace. However, instead of screaming  cut! cut! cut!  as Republicans are inclined to do, we could fully pay for it and have a little over $40 billion a year left to do other things with.Here is a chart showing the costs of a few things, and where the extra money falls in comparison. It s so embarrassing. We could do two of the cheapest ones at the same time and still have a little money left over. But, Republicans are bound and determined to make sure America can t have nice things.Featured image via Flickr\",\n          \"How Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal ElectionsHow Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal Elections\\nAmericans are being told by \\u201cexperts\\u201d (read \\u201cHillary supporters\\u201d) that election fraud in the US is rare. They are also being misinformed that voting fraud would be detected. The fact of the matter is, as has now been proven, that no vast conspiracy is required. One person suffices to have the machine count the votes as desired.

NEW Wikileaks Email: Confidential Auditor\\u2019s Report States Clinton Foundation Is Engaging In ILLEGAL ConductThe report exposed in an email shared by Wikileaks shows the results of a review that was completed in 2011, by Jennifer Reynoso, a New York lawyer. The report states that the Clinton Foundation  is missing several policies/procedures that are required by law (e.g.,record retention policy). The report goes on to give the following recommendation:In addition to pointing out that employees of the Clinton Foundation are underpaid as compared to comparable  positions in other companies, the email also states that the overall morale of the company is low and the staff would like to see more structure.  STAFF MORALE IS LOW AND STAFF IS HUNGRY FOR MORE STRUCTUREIronically, the staff complained about a policy not being made available for an employee to  blow the whistle  on potential wrongdoings within the  non-profit. Given Bill Clinton s history as a sexual predator and his role in the Clinton Foundation, it shouldn t come as a surprise that there isn t a strong  Sexual Harassment  policy in place.\",\n          \" Here Are Just A Few Things America Could Afford If The Wealthy Actually PAID Their Fair ShareIt isn t much of a secret these days that rich people do not pay their fair share of taxes. I m not even talking about the small business owner who loves to complain about having a higher tax bill than some. I mean the offensively wealthy. Multi-millionaires and billionaires that draw a salary they don t need just so they can have a larger pile of money to sit on top of while throwing a middle finger at the middle class.Did you ever wonder,  What could we do in this country if everyone actually paid their fair share of taxes on a progressive scale? The short answer is, we d have about $124 billion extra per year for the government to use.Thanks to a leak of the Panama Papers, which detail just how much money is being hidden by corporations, the wealthy and even world leaders, we can now start to answer that question. Here are a few examples of what we could do with the money:1: Help to reduce the deficitRepublicans always say the federal deficit is the great evil of our time. It prevents everything from your business succeeding to sunny days from happening. $124 billion dollars a year would be able to negate nearly one quarter of the federal deficit. Republicans are strangely silent on this obvious remedy.2: Help to protect the elderlyThanks to Republican shenanigans, Social Security has some budget problems. Currently, it s experiencing a shortfall of about $182 billion because people like Ronald Reagan couldn t keep their hands out of the Social Security lockbox. Rather than consigning our seniors to complete and total poverty for generations to come, $124 billion extra a year could help resolve the Social Security problem until another method can be used to patch the rest and protect 80-year-olds from having to work full-time jobs.3: Fund universal preschoolUniversal pre-k would cost about $90 billion a year. We would actually have money left over from this one. The Economic Policy Institute has already put forth a plan to establish preschool and childcare for parents of infants and toddlers up to 4 years old for just 10 percent of their income. The government would pick up the rest of the tab. The plan would end up paying for itself in the long-term because younger children educated earlier in life will earn more and avoid the need for social welfare programs and have fewer run-ins with our drastically expensive criminal justice system.4: Pay the full salaries of all of our troopsThe Pentagon s personnel costs in 2014 totaled $116 billion dollars. Here we are again with some absolutely huge and important thing being paid for with money to spare, yet Republicans are silent. Strangely enough, even the troops don t motivate them on this one. Republicans LOVE our troops. Right? Sadly no, they don t. They only love having flag draped coffins for photo ops.5: Make sure nobody in America goes hungryAt its recent peak, food stamps cost $80 billion dollars in 2013. It has since lowered as the economy has steadily improved and people have gotten off the program at a modest pace. However, instead of screaming  cut! cut! cut!  as Republicans are inclined to do, we could fully pay for it and have a little over $40 billion a year left to do other things with.Here is a chart showing the costs of a few things, and where the extra money falls in comparison. It s so embarrassing. We could do two of the cheapest ones at the same time and still have a little money left over. But, Republicans are bound and determined to make sure America can t have nice things.Featured image via Flickr\",\n          \"How Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal ElectionsHow Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal Elections\\nAmericans are being told by \\u201cexperts\\u201d (read \\u201cHillary supporters\\u201d) that election fraud in the US is rare. They are also being misinformed that voting fraud would be detected. The fact of the matter is, as has now been proven, that no vast conspiracy is required. One person suffices to have the machine count the votes as desired. Once the vote is recorded the code erases the elements that would reveal the fraud. \\nThe entire purpose of the presstitutes reporting a non-existent Hillary lead is to create in advance acceptance that she won, thereby discrediting in advance any challenge to the rigged outcome.\\nhttps://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2016/10/31/biggest-election-fraud-in-history-discovered-in-the-united-states/ \\nThe post How Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal Elections appeared first on PaulCraigRoberts.org .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19202,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"break new wikileak email confidential auditor report states clinton foundation engage illegal conductthe report expose email share wikileak show result review complete 2011 jennifer reynoso new york lawyer report state clinton foundation miss policiesprocedure require law egrecord retention policy report go follow recommendationin addition point employee clinton foundation underpaid compare comparable position company email state overall morale company low staff like structure staff morale low staff hungry structureironically staff complain policy available employee blow whistle potential wrongdoing nonprofit give bill clinton s history sexual predator role clinton foundation shouldn t come surprise isn t strong sexual harassment policy place\",\n          \"professor call election president trump act terrorism choose professor year videoprofessor olga cox teach human sexuality orange coast college tell class december election donald trump act terrorism despite cox recently nominate select fellow faculty member professor year awardaccorde student orange coast college tradition recipient annual professor year award keynote speaker school s graduation ceremony year s act terrorism professor cox say class december president trump s election frightening thing people life continue people commit assault stranger country come attack sense mean american thing stand make painful s video capture professor olga cox s disgusting remarksher comment videotape occ student caleb o neil suspend school allegedly unlawfully record indignant professor school retract punishment face backlashthe selection professor year award committee consist faculty staff administrator base rubric take account multiple factor include teach service campus community involvement despite nationwide negative attention condemnation community wake incident committee recommend professor cox choice receive professor year occ administration accept committee s nominationdoug bennett executive director college advancement occ confirm red alert politic email professor cox win nomination professor year award decline accept member campus community nominate professor cox award committee select rubric award isn t decline say bennett red alert politic\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

NEW Wikileaks Email: Confidential Auditor\\u2019s Report States Clinton Foundation Is Engaging In ILLEGAL ConductThe report exposed in an email shared by Wikileaks shows the results of a review that was completed in 2011, by Jennifer Reynoso, a New York lawyer. The report states that the Clinton Foundation  is missing several policies/procedures that are required by law (e.g.,record retention policy). The report goes on to give the following recommendation:In addition to pointing out that employees of the Clinton Foundation are underpaid as compared to comparable  positions in other companies, the email also states that the overall morale of the company is low and the staff would like to see more structure.  STAFF MORALE IS LOW AND STAFF IS HUNGRY FOR MORE STRUCTUREIronically, the staff complained about a policy not being made available for an employee to  blow the whistle  on potential wrongdoings within the  non-profit. Given Bill Clinton s history as a sexual predator and his role in the Clinton Foundation, it shouldn t come as a surprise that there isn t a strong  Sexual Harassment  policy in place.\",\n          \" Here Are Just A Few Things America Could Afford If The Wealthy Actually PAID Their Fair ShareIt isn t much of a secret these days that rich people do not pay their fair share of taxes. I m not even talking about the small business owner who loves to complain about having a higher tax bill than some. I mean the offensively wealthy. Multi-millionaires and billionaires that draw a salary they don t need just so they can have a larger pile of money to sit on top of while throwing a middle finger at the middle class.Did you ever wonder,  What could we do in this country if everyone actually paid their fair share of taxes on a progressive scale? The short answer is, we d have about $124 billion extra per year for the government to use.Thanks to a leak of the Panama Papers, which detail just how much money is being hidden by corporations, the wealthy and even world leaders, we can now start to answer that question. Here are a few examples of what we could do with the money:1: Help to reduce the deficitRepublicans always say the federal deficit is the great evil of our time. It prevents everything from your business succeeding to sunny days from happening. $124 billion dollars a year would be able to negate nearly one quarter of the federal deficit. Republicans are strangely silent on this obvious remedy.2: Help to protect the elderlyThanks to Republican shenanigans, Social Security has some budget problems. Currently, it s experiencing a shortfall of about $182 billion because people like Ronald Reagan couldn t keep their hands out of the Social Security lockbox. Rather than consigning our seniors to complete and total poverty for generations to come, $124 billion extra a year could help resolve the Social Security problem until another method can be used to patch the rest and protect 80-year-olds from having to work full-time jobs.3: Fund universal preschoolUniversal pre-k would cost about $90 billion a year. We would actually have money left over from this one. The Economic Policy Institute has already put forth a plan to establish preschool and childcare for parents of infants and toddlers up to 4 years old for just 10 percent of their income. The government would pick up the rest of the tab. The plan would end up paying for itself in the long-term because younger children educated earlier in life will earn more and avoid the need for social welfare programs and have fewer run-ins with our drastically expensive criminal justice system.4: Pay the full salaries of all of our troopsThe Pentagon s personnel costs in 2014 totaled $116 billion dollars. Here we are again with some absolutely huge and important thing being paid for with money to spare, yet Republicans are silent. Strangely enough, even the troops don t motivate them on this one. Republicans LOVE our troops. Right? Sadly no, they don t. They only love having flag draped coffins for photo ops.5: Make sure nobody in America goes hungryAt its recent peak, food stamps cost $80 billion dollars in 2013. It has since lowered as the economy has steadily improved and people have gotten off the program at a modest pace. However, instead of screaming  cut! cut! cut!  as Republicans are inclined to do, we could fully pay for it and have a little over $40 billion a year left to do other things with.Here is a chart showing the costs of a few things, and where the extra money falls in comparison. It s so embarrassing. We could do two of the cheapest ones at the same time and still have a little money left over. But, Republicans are bound and determined to make sure America can t have nice things.Featured image via Flickr\",\n          \"How Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal ElectionsHow Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal Elections\\nAmericans are being told by \\u201cexperts\\u201d (read \\u201cHillary supporters\\u201d) that election fraud in the US is rare. They are also being misinformed that voting fraud would be detected. The fact of the matter is, as has now been proven, that no vast conspiracy is required. One person suffices to have the machine count the votes as desired. Once the vote is recorded the code erases the elements that would reveal the fraud. \\nThe entire purpose of the presstitutes reporting a non-existent Hillary lead is to create in advance acceptance that she won, thereby discrediting in advance any challenge to the rigged outcome.\\nhttps://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2016/10/31/biggest-election-fraud-in-history-discovered-in-the-united-states/ \\nThe post How Voting Machines Are Programmed In Order To Steal Elections appeared first on PaulCraigRoberts.org .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19201,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"trump threaten murder 25 million people word offend himon saturday night donald trump casually threaten nuclear war country north korea time come arguably weak package sanction penalize individual business dictatorship time snowflake trump trigger north korea s foreign minister speak unri yong ho tell assembly week s exchange insult trump apparent archnemesis kim jong un rocket s visit entire mainland inevitable apparently threaten aim north korean missile directly united states isolated peninsular nation account year away develop technology actually reach ustrump fire backjust hear foreign minister north korea speak un echo thought little rocket man will not long donald j trump realdonaldtrump september 24 2017trump add adjective new nickname kim trumpifye rocket man surely believe dagger heart 33yearold dictator win t course include 25 million inhabitant north korea small nuclear weapon cause inconceivable damage geographically insignificant countrytrump undoubtedly attempt deflect attention away weekend misadventure alabama earn scorn sport fan america racist nfl owner fire player kneel national anthem unpatriotic call don t think donald trump know patriotism isit certainly isn t make america look like global bully take offense meaningless statement hostile foreign ministerfeature image spencer plattgetty image\",\n          \"croatian police detain executive agrokorzagreb reuters croatian police arrest senior executive agrokoragrokul series raid monday investigation allege financial irregularity heavily indebted food producer retail conglomerate state prosecutor s office dorh say statement investigation target 15 individual suspect economic crime fraud local medium report 300 police officer engage operation dorh issue official statement arrest local medium say detain take dorh premise question tuesday arrest ivan crnjac agrokor s deputy finance strategy president ljerka puljic exsupervisory board member aide founder ivica todoric board member tomislav lucic state news agency hina say police detain agrokor s management member piruska canjuga damir kustrak vicepresident mislav galic executive marijan alagu alojzije pand todoric s lawyer jadranka slokovic say residence raid provide detail say arrest agrokor s executive start political showdown todoric hina report prime minister andrej plenkovic dismiss allegation say political persecution utmost interest fully disentangle issue important establish cause consequence proceed plenkovic add agrokor big employer balkan 60000 staff staterun administration april suffer liquidity debt crisis todoric say blog post monday currently available willing disposal judiciary parliamentary commission deny wrongdoing associate croatian lawmaker approve appointment parliamentary commission investigate agrokor run trouble crisis manager ante ramljak say press criminal charge responsible financial irregularity l8n1mh1zy audit order company s stateappointed management perform pricewaterhousecooper pwc show net loss 2015 36 billion kuna 565 million net profit 12 billion kuna release previous management audit value agrokor s net worth 2015 2016 reduce 22 billion kuna agrokor owe creditor include supplier bondholder bank big portion debt 11 billion euro 130 billion hold russia s sberbank creditor say\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
